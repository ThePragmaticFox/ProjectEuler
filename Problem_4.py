# Largest palindrome product
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Complexity:
# Time O(((10 ** n) ** 2) * (n ** 2))
# Space O(1)
